# SETUP
the setup for zip format modding is a bit wonky 
i hope youre not planning on using linux lmao

## Install First
(GodotSteam)[https://codeberg.org/godotsteam/godotsteam/releases]
(7-zip)[7-zip.org] (needed for properly zipping with .bat)

## Cloning the repo
clone this NOT inside the project files.

## Paths and stuff 
little bit of final setup:
- edit packer.bat and specify your project path
- make sure the path to 7-zip in packer.bat is correct
- make sure you have a "mods-unpacked" folder in your project folder, and make sure its EMPTY

and it should hopefully work

# RUNNING THE MOD
- open vscode console
- write `./patcher.bat` to pack and replace the mod
- run the game from inside godotsteam

I was really bored during math so i wrote a readme lol
